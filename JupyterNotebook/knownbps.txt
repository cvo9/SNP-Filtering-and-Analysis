rs10490924 	G/T 	10 	124214448 	WITHIN_NON_CODING_GENE 	Wet neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 	rs10490924 was identified as a risk factor from chromosome 10 related to age related macular degeneration. The risk allele is (T). Odds ratios for heterozygotes and homozygotes are, respectively, 2.69 (CI: 2.22-3.27) and 8.21 (CI: 5.79-11.65).PMID 16174643 Disease risk in combination with the rs1061170 SNP in the CFH gene is dramatically increased. Homozygotes for both the rare/risk alleles at both loci are estimated to be at 57 fold higher risk for age related macular degeneration than individuals homozygous for the common alleles at both loci. PMID 16174643 A subsequent study indicated that the risk based on solely the ARMS2 SNP rs10490924 is significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. PMID 16642439 Note that this SNP is completely predictive (ie is in perfect linkage disequilibrium) with rs11200638, thus the status of one predicts the status of the other.

rs10490924 	G/T 	10 	124214448 	WITHIN_NON_CODING_GENE 	Bone mass and geometry-Hip geometry, femoral neck length, gender differentiated in females 	rs10490924 was identified as a risk factor from chromosome 10 related to age related macular degeneration. The risk allele is (T). Odds ratios for heterozygotes and homozygotes are, respectively, 2.69 (CI: 2.22-3.27) and 8.21 (CI: 5.79-11.65).PMID 16174643 Disease risk in combination with the rs1061170 SNP in the CFH gene is dramatically increased. Homozygotes for both the rare/risk alleles at both loci are estimated to be at 57 fold higher risk for age related macular degeneration than individuals homozygous for the common alleles at both loci. PMID 16174643 A subsequent study indicated that the risk based on solely the ARMS2 SNP rs10490924 is significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. PMID 16642439 Note that this SNP is completely predictive (ie is in perfect linkage disequilibrium) with rs11200638, thus the status of one predicts the status of the other.

rs1057910 	A/C 	10 	96741053 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Warfarin maintenance dose 	SNP rs1057910(A), located in the cytochrome p450 CYP2C9 gene, most commonly encodes the amino acid isoleucine at position 359, and the resulting allele is also known as CYP2C9*1. rs1057910(C) encodes a leucine at this same position, and the resulting allele is called CYP2C9*3. The effect of CYP2C9 variants on drug metabolism cannot be predicted without considering CYP2C9*2, defined as the common loss of function variant rs1799853(T) (NM_000771:c.430C>T, NP_000762:p.144R>C) PMID 8004131 http://www.pharmgkb.org/search/annotatedGene/cyp2c9/. Studies of the effects of these alleles include: * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes may clear drugs like celecoxib (trade name Celebrex) twice as slowly as rs1057910(A;A) genotypes; the rs1057910(A;C) genotypes are in-between clearance rates. Lower clearance rates will lead to higher internal concentrations of the drug. It is not clear whether this could lead to increased efficacy and/or increased side effects. PMID 12893985 * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of tolbutamide, a sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drug used in the treatment of diabetes. PMID 8873220 * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of phenytoin, a drug used to treat epilepsy, and therefore tend to need lower doses. PMID 15805193 * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of glipizide, a second generation sulfonylurea drug structurally similar to tolbutamide and also used as an oral hypoglycemic agent. PMID 10208645 * rs1057910(C;C) genotypes are poor metabolizers of warfarin, and therefore unusually sensitive.

rs1061170 	C/T 	1 	196659237 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	 	rs1061170 is a SNP in the complement factor H CFH gene; it is also known as Tyr402His. This SNP may influence the likelihood of age related macular degeneration. This http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/296/3/301 research paper shows that CFH Y402H is the relevant mutation.

rs1229984 	T/C 	4 	100239319 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Esophageal cancer 	A SNP in rs1229984 encodes a form of the alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1B gene that significantly reduces the clearance rate of alcohol from the liver. The allele, known in the literature as ADH2*2, with reduced activity is rs1229984(A). Individuals with one or especially two ADH2*2 alleles, ie genotypes rs1229984(A;G) or rs1229984(A;A) are more likely to find drinking unpleasant and have a somewhat reduced risk for alcoholism. PMID 7635462 A study of over 3,800 cases of "upper aerodigestive" cancers (mouth/throat, voice box, and esophageal cancers) concluded that the rs1229984(A) allele (in dbSNP orientation) has a protective effect. Carriers of this allele had a 0.56x (decreased; p=10<sup>-10</sup>) risk of having one of these cancer types.PMID 18500343 A review of the (at times conflicting) findings regarding ADH1B genotypes and maternal and fetal alcohol syndromes is available.http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/hugenet/file/print/reviews/alcohol.pdf Note: this is not the SNP associated with the "Asian Blush" (rs671), although there are several studies looking at individuals with varying combinations of SNPs rs671 and rs1229984.

rs17817449 	T/G 	16 	53813367 	INTRONIC 	 	Within the FTO gene, many SNPs appear to be co-inherited. The SNP showing the strongest association with body weight (i.e. body mass index, BMI) is not rs17817449, although this SNP is one of co-inherited SNPs in the FTO gene region. For more information, refer to the FTO gene or the most studied of FTO SNPs, rs9930506. PMID 17658951 PMID 18316358 A study of 900+ Quebec individuals reported that rs17817449 was associated with BMI (p=0.0014), weight (p=0.0059) and waist circumference (p=0.0021) under an additive model, and in addition, influenced fasting insulin (p=0.011) and HOMA-IR (p=0.038). * Note: The three FTO SNPs, rs1421085, rs17817449, and rs9939609, are in strong linkage disequilibrium (pairwise r<sup>2</sup>>0.97), and there are two primary haplotypes, C-G-A (42.0 %) and T-T-T (55.5 %).

PMID 17554300 The same (A) allele of rs2104286, which is located in the first intron of the IL2RA gene, was calculated to confer a slight increase (19%) in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis.

This SNP was most strongly associated with female patients and those positive for antinuclear antibodies. Genotype data for SNP rs2104286 for controls was combined with the data for that SNP obtained from a genome-wide association study (WTCCC GWA), giving a total control sample size of 6787. This association with rs2104286 was replicated in a second study cohort of JIA cases from the USA (odds ratio 0.84, CI: 0.65-1.0, trend p=0.05). Meta-analysis of the two cohorts yielded highly significant evidence for association (odds ratio 0.76, CI: 0.62-0.88, p-value 4.9 x 10<sup>-6</sup>).

PMID 17200669, PMID 17435756 In another recent (2007) report, rs2241880 is confirmed to be associated with both Crohn's disease and ileal disease, but additionally, the authors calculate risk for individuals who are homozygotes for this SNP plus 2 others (in the IBD5 and NOD2 genes). Individuals homozygous for the risk alleles for all 3 of these SNPs are estimated to be at 20 fold higher risk (CI ~9-49) for Crohn's disease. PMID 17484864 From the largest most recent survey, the Crohn's disease-associated SNPs for IBD5 and NOD2 are, respectively, rs6596075 and rs17221417. PMID 17554300 PMID 18047540 associated With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases but Not With Celiac Disease rs11209026 had a protective effect for IBD in the case-control analysis (odds ratio OR 0.19, 95% confidence interval CI 0.10-0.37, P= 6.6E-09). Both CD (OR 0.14, CI 0.06-0.37, P= 3.9E-07) and UC (OR 0.33, CI 0.15-0.73, P= 1.4E-03) were associated with IL23R. rs2241880 was associated with CD susceptibility (OR 1.36, CI 1.12-1.66, P= 0.0017). The population-attributable risk of carrying allele G is 0.24 and is 0.19 for homozygosity for allele G in CD.

PMID 17200669, PMID 17435756 In another recent (2007) report, rs2241880 is confirmed to be associated with both Crohn's disease and ileal disease, but additionally, the authors calculate risk for individuals who are homozygotes for this SNP plus 2 others (in the IBD5 and NOD2 genes). Individuals homozygous for the risk alleles for all 3 of these SNPs are estimated to be at 20 fold higher risk (CI ~9-49) for Crohn's disease. PMID 17484864 From the largest most recent survey, the Crohn's disease-associated SNPs for IBD5 and NOD2 are, respectively, rs6596075 and rs17221417. PMID 17554300 PMID 18047540 associated With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases but Not With Celiac Disease rs11209026 had a protective effect for IBD in the case-control analysis (odds ratio OR 0.19, 95% confidence interval CI 0.10-0.37, P= 6.6E-09). Both CD (OR 0.14, CI 0.06-0.37, P= 3.9E-07) and UC (OR 0.33, CI 0.15-0.73, P= 1.4E-03) were associated with IL23R. rs2241880 was associated with CD susceptibility (OR 1.36, CI 1.12-1.66, P= 0.0017). The population-attributable risk of carrying allele G is 0.24 and is 0.19 for homozygosity for allele G in CD. In another study, rs2241880 has been associated with Crohn's disease; the minor allele is somewhat protective in that it lessens the odds of acquiring the disease (odds ratio 0.74, CI: 0.65-0.84, p=3.7x10e-6).PMID 18162085 Review of role of rs2241880 in Crohn's disease and possibly ulcerative colitis 	SCARNA5 	ENSG00000212514 	Small Cajal body specific RNA 6

This SNP is estimated to explain 9.6% of the total variation in the viral set point. Humans show remarkable variation in vulnerability to infection by HIV-1 and especially in the clinical outcome following infection. One striking and largely unexplained difference is the level of circulating virus in the plasma during the non-symptomatic phase preceding progression to AIDS. This is known as the ''viral set point'' and can vary among individuals by as much as 4 to 5 logs. The HCP5 (HLA complex P5) gene is located 100 kb centromeric from HLAB on chromosome 6. HCP5 is a good candidate to interact with HIV-1, possibly through an antisense mechanism. Moreover, HCP5 is predicted to encode two proteins, and the associated polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution in one of these. rs9264942 is also reported to be associated with reduced HIV viral load set point. http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v38/n10/fig_tab/ng1885_T1.html nature Abacavir hypersensitivity rs2395029 PMID 18369459 rs2395029 reported to be associated with psoriasis in a large US/UK study 	 	ENSG00000206337 	HLA complex P5 (HCP5), mRNA

This SNP is estimated to explain 9.6% of the total variation in the viral set point. Humans show remarkable variation in vulnerability to infection by HIV-1 and especially in the clinical outcome following infection. One striking and largely unexplained difference is the level of circulating virus in the plasma during the non-symptomatic phase preceding progression to AIDS.

PMID 16352685 In Asian (Japanese) populations, the presence of an rs3087243(G) allele represents a 1.3 fold increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and for those with autoimmune thyroid disease, a 1.5 fold increased risk of type-1 diabetes. However, in individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease, no association was seen between this SNP and type-1 diabetes. The authors speculate that earlier studies may have reported associations between this SNP and type-1 diabetes that were actually primarily based on the association with autoimmune thyroid disease. This same SNP, rs3087243, has also been implicated as a (minor) risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A study of 2,000+ European RA patients led to a calculated odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.03 - 1.24) for the rs3087243(G) risk allele. PMID 16380915 In a study of 395 Spanish patients with lupus, rs3087243(G) allele carriers were calculated to have an odds ratio of 1.71 (CI: 1.18-2.49, p=0.003, p(corr) = 0.006).PMID 15248219 In a different study involving recipients of liver transplants, although also with Spanish patients, the rs3087243(G) allele was significantly associated with acute rejection (odds ratio 1.49, p(corr)=0.038). Patients who lacked this allele had the lowest risk of acute rejection development.

rs3736228 	C/T 	11 	68201295 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Bone mineral density 	rs3736228 is a SNP in the LRP5 gene that is also known as Ala1330Val; the more common (C) allele encodes the Ala (alanine), while the rarer (T) allele encodes the Val (valine), which is the risk allele. rs3736228(T) is associated with vertebral fractures and reduced bone mineral density (BMD), with an overall odds ratio for fractures of 1.06 per allele (CI: 1.01-1.12; 7802 fractures among 31,199 individuals studied). More specifically, the rs3736228(T) allele was associated with reduced lumbar spine BMD (p = 2.6 x 10<sup>-9</sup>), and femoral neck BMD (p = 5.0 x 10<sup>-6</sup>).PMID 18349089 Note that rs4988321, another LRP5 SNP (also known as Val667Met), was independently associated with BMD in this same study.PMID 18349089 http://www.medpagetoday.com/Endocrinology/Osteoporosis/tb/9271 news rs3736228 was associated with a 30% increase in the risk of both osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. Both increases were significant, at P=0.002 and P=0.008, respectively. rs3736228 associated with decreased bone mineral density (p=6.3x10(-12) for lumbar spine and p=1.9x10(-4) for femoral neck) and an increased risk of both osteoporotic fractures (odds ratio OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.09-1.52, p=0.002) and osteoporosis (OR 1.3, 1.08-1.63, p=0.008). rs4355801 associated with decreased bone mineral density (p=7.6x10(-10) for lumbar spine and p=3.3x10(-8) for femoral neck) and increased risk of osteoporosis (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01-1.42, p=0.038). The presence of both risk alleles increased the risk of osteoporotic fractures (OR 1.3, 1.08-1.63, p=0.006) and this effect was independent of bone mineral density 	LRP5 	ENSG00000162337 	low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 	4041 	low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 	OSTEOPETROSIS, AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT 1; VAN BUCHEM DISEASE, TYPE 2; BONE MINERAL DENSITY QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS 1; EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY 4; OSTEOPOROSIS-PSEUDOGLIOMA SYNDROME; OSTEOPOROSIS; HYPEROSTOSIS CORTICALIS GENERALISATA, BENIGN FORM OF WORTH, WITH TORUS 	retinopathy | osteoporosis | fracture risk | hypertension | fractures | obesity | bone density vitamin D | diabetes, type 1 | sex hormones | osteoarthritis | bone density 	VISION | IMMUNE | METABOLIC | OTHER | CARDIOVASCULAR 	Fractures, Bone | Genetic Predisposition to Disease | Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 | Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal | Osteoarthritis | Vitreoretinopathy, Proliferative | Body Weight | Hypertension | Osteoporosis | Obesity | Spondylarthritis

rs4149056 	T/C 	12 	21331549 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Serum bilirubin levels 	rs4149056 is a SNP in the SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes the 'organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1' (OATP1B1) protein. This protein, found primarily in the liver, regulates the uptake of numerous drugs and natural compounds. The rs4149056(C) allele gives rise to an amino acid change (from valine to alanine at residue 174) which has reduced uptake/transport activity. Therefore, drugs metabolized by OATP1B1 tend to build up to higher circulating concentrations than they would otherwise. Although there are also several other SNPs described from the SLCO1B1 gene, other than rs4149056, they don't (yet?) have obvious medical consequences PMID 16758257. The drugs known (or in some cases, thought) to be transported less well by the variant OATP1B1 protein encoded by the rs4149056(C) allele include: *Several cholesterol lowering statins, generally leading to reduced inhibitory effects on liver cholesterol synthesis and possibly worse side effects, by such drugs as: **pravastatin **rosuvastatin **pitavastatin *fexofenadine *repaglinide *methotrexate *the SN-38 active metabolite of irinotecan *rifampicin *caspofungin *lopinavir http://spittoon.23andme.com/2008/07/24/snpwatch-gene-variant-may-increase-risk-for-rare-side-effect-of-cholesterol-lowering-drugs/ spittoon discussion of this snp http://thegenesherpa.blogspot.com/2008/08/muscle-pain-from-statins-time-for.html The Gene Sherpa points out a 16x odds ratio for myopathy when taking statins and suggests fenofibrates might be a good alterative.

rs429358 	T/C 	19 	45411941 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	 	This SNP, located in the fourth exon of the ApoE gene, affects the amino acid at position 130 of the resulting protein. The more common rs429358 allele is (T); if the allele is (C) and the same chromosome also harbors the rs7412(C) allele, this allele is known as an ApoE4 allele. The risk for both early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease is increased for ApoE4 allele carriers, and it appears to be relatively dose-dependent. Therefore, the highest risk genotype is rs429358(C;C). Many studies have estimated the level of risk, and it varies depending on age, sex, ethnicity, and other factors. One meta-analysis estimated the odds ratios for homozygous rs429358(C;C) individuals compared to the more common ApoE3/ApoE3 homozygotes to be 12x for late-onset Alzheimer's and 61x for early-onset disease. PMID 10325447 Note: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus predictive of it.

At least one copy of the risk allele (A) of rs4355801 was found in 79% of study participants. Participants carrying at least one copy of each risk allele -- 22% of the study population -- had a 50% increased risk of osteoporosis, which was significant at P=0.0026, and a 29% increased risk of osteoporotic fractures (significant at P=0.014). rs3736228 associated with decreased bone mineral density (p=6.3x10(-12) for lumbar spine and p=1.9x10(-4) for femoral neck) and an increased risk of both osteoporotic fractures (odds ratio OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.09-1.52, p=0.002) and osteoporosis (OR 1.3, 1.08-1.63, p=0.008). rs4355801 associated with decreased bone mineral density (p=7.6x10(-10) for lumbar spine and p=3.3x10(-8) for femoral neck) and increased risk of osteoporosis (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01-1.42, p=0.038). The presence of both risk alleles increased the risk of osteoporotic fractures (OR 1.3, 1.08-1.63, p=0.006) and this effect was independent of bone mineral density

Studies involving Swedish PMID 16978373and Japanese PMID 10773353 T1D patients have reported one or the other of the rs5498 alleles to represent increased T1D risk; studies involving British, Finnish, and Danish patients have not seen any association between rs5498 and T1D PMID 11132145, PMID 10902613. In a study of the type-1 diabetes complication known as diabetic nephropathy (DN), 662 (312 female/350 male) T1D patients with DN and 620 (369/251) without DN were studied (all were Swedish Caucasians).

rs6983267 	G/T 	8 	128413305 	WITHIN_NON_CODING_GENE 	Prostate cancer 	rs6983267 is a SNP on chromosome 8q24, associated with increased risk for prostate cancer in several studies. In studies dividing the 8q24 region, this SNP falls in region 3. In a study of over 3,600 Caucasians with prostate cancer, rs6983267 is one of five SNPs used (with family history as a sixth factor) to cumulatively predict overall risk. On their own, the rs6983267(G;G) and (G;T) risk genotypes yield an odds ratio for developing prostate cancer of 1.37 (CI: 1.18-1.59, p=3.4-10e-5) and may account for 22.2% of population attributable risk. The increased risk of developing prostate cancer associated with rs6983267 now appears to be independent of the risk associated with it's close neighbor, rs1447295. The odds ratio for heterozygotes is estimated to be 1.26 (CI: 1.13 - 1.41), and for homozygotes, 1.58 (CI: 1.40 - 1.78), compared to the homozygote rs6983267(T;T) genotype. PMID 17401363 http://www.pharmalive.com/News/index.cfm?articleid=428514&categoryid=40 The rs1447295 location could be responsible for about seven percent of prostate cancer cases in white men of north European descent. Thus, taken together with rs6983267, these two genetic changes could account for as much as one quarter of Prostate cancer|prostate cancer cases in white men. The increased risk conferred by these loci was observed for all age groups studied. cancer related according to this http://cancergenetics.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/association-with-prostate-and-colon-cancer-8q24/ blog We estimate that the population attributable risk of the new locus, marked by rs6983267, is higher than the locus marked by rs1447295 (21% vs. 9%) PMID 17826675 In a study of 1,563 patients of European ancestry, this SNP was designated as the representative of a prostate cancer risk region termed "locus 2", with an odds ratio of 1.70 (CI: 1.39-2.07) for carriers of a risk genotype. Two other regions of chromosome 8q24 were also studied.PMID 17925536 In follow-up studies looking at disease severity (and not just overall risk), this SNP is reported to account for the risk (from region 3) of advanced prostate cancer. A meta-analysis of 10+ studies comprising over 15,000 prostate cancer patients concluded that the odds ratio for rs6983267(G) allele carriers is 1.25 (CI: 1.24-1.26).PMID 18231127 A study of 561 patients with colon cancer has found that rs6983267(G;T) and (G;G) genotypes have an age-adjusted odds ratio of 1.39 (CI:1.03-1.88) and 1.68 (CI:1.21-2.33), respectively, for the development of that disease compared to (T;T) genotypes.PMID 18268117 PMID 17618284 rs6983267 P = 1.27 x 10(-14) (allelic test) overall, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.27 (95% confidence interval (c.i.): 1.16-1.39) and 1.47 (95% c.i.: 1.34-1.62) for heterozygotes and rare homozygotes, respectively with colorectal adenoma PMID 18056436 associated with risk of colorectal cancer: Inheriting the risk variant at both this SNP and rs4779584 is estimated to increase the overall risk of developing colorectal cancer about 3 fold.

rs7903146 	C/T 	10 	114758349 	INTRONIC 	Type 2 diabetes 	This SNP in TCF7L2 influences the risk of Type-2 diabetes (T2D). PMID 17671651 rs7903146(C;T) rs7903146(T;T) strongly predicted future type-2 diabetes. Considered in context with rs7903146 rs12255372 rs10885406. Note: this is one of two SNPs within the TCF7L2 gene that have been reported to be associated with type-2 diabetes, the other being rs4506565. They have approximately equal power to estimate risk for type-2 diabetes, and the results from one correlate 92% of the time with the other. PMID 17554300 http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/request=get-documentamp?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030374 Full text of the paper is available from from Plos Medicine. Or from NCBI as PMID 17020404. PMID 16855264 TCF7L2 polymorphisms and progression to diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program. PMID 17668382 reconfirmed in a diverse population PMID 17971425 Associated in a study of ~1000 Hispanic-Americans with reduced insulin secretion as measured by acute insulin response and adjusted for the degree of insulin sensitivity (p = 0.032). PMID 17671651 the CT/TT genotypes strongly predicted future type-2 diabetes. The risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion, incretin effects, and enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production.
