The risk allele is (T). Odds ratios for heterozygotes and homozygotes are, respectively, 2.69 (CI: 2.22-3.27) and 8.21 (CI: 5.79-11.65).PMID 16174643 Disease risk in combination with the rs1061170 SNP in the CFH gene is dramatically increased. Homozygotes for both the rare/risk alleles at both loci are estimated to be at 57 fold higher risk for age related macular degeneration than individuals homozygous for the common alleles at both loci. PMID 16174643 A subsequent study indicated that the risk based on solely the ARMS2 SNP rs10490924 is significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. PMID 16642439 Note that this SNP is completely predictive (ie is in perfect linkage disequilibrium) with rs11200638, thus the status of one predicts the status of the other.

rs1051730 	G/A 	15 	78894339 	SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Lung cancer 	rs1051730, also known as D398N, is a SNP in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 3 subunit CHRNA3 gene. In two recent (2008) studies, together comprising over 6,000 lung cancer patients of European ancestry, the rs1051730(T) allele was very significiantly associated with increased risk. Having one copy (i.e. being a rs1051730(C;T) genotype) increased risk for lung cancer about 1.3x, and having two copies (rs1051730(T;T) individuals) represented 1.8x increased risk. Up to 14% of lung cancer incidence may be attributable to this allele.PMID 18385738, PMID 18385676 An independent study published at the same time concluded that (T) allele carriers for SNP rs1051730 are not at higher risk of becoming smokers compared to (C) carriers. However, if they do smoke, (T) carriers are quite likely to smoke more cigarettes than (C) carriers, and as an apparent consequence, they are at higher risk for lung cancer as reported in this and other studies. This study therefore links rs1051730 directly to nicotine dependence, and indirectly to lung cancer.PMID 18385739 Note: publications tend to refer to the risk allele as "A", however, the orientation reported for rs1051730 in dbSNP is for the opposite strand, so in keeping with reporting all SNPs in the orientation published in dbSNP, SNPedia refers to this same risk allele as the (T) allele.

This study therefore links rs1051730 directly to nicotine dependence, and indirectly to lung cancer.PMID 18385739 Note: publications tend to refer to the risk allele as "A", however, the orientation reported for rs1051730 in dbSNP is for the opposite strand, so in keeping with reporting all SNPs in the orientation published in dbSNP, SNPedia refers to this same risk allele as the (T) allele.

rs1051730 	G/A 	15 	78894339 	SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Lung adenocarcinoma 	rs1051730, also known as D398N, is a SNP in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 3 subunit CHRNA3 gene. In two recent (2008) studies, together comprising over 6,000 lung cancer patients of European ancestry, the rs1051730(T) allele was very significiantly associated with increased risk. Having one copy (i.e. being a rs1051730(C;T) genotype) increased risk for lung cancer about 1.3x, and having two copies (rs1051730(T;T) individuals) represented 1.8x increased risk. Up to 14% of lung cancer incidence may be attributable to this allele.PMID 18385738, PMID 18385676 An independent study published at the same time concluded that (T) allele carriers for SNP rs1051730 are not at higher risk of becoming smokers compared to (C) carriers.

rs1219648 	A/G 	10 	123346190 	INTRONIC 	Breast Cancer 	Based on a study of ~2500 female patients of European ancestry with sporadic postmenopausal breast cancer, this SNP in the FGFR2 showed the greatest risk. The risk allele is rs1219648(G), with a pooled odds ratio of 1.64 (CI:1.42-1.90) for rs1219648(G;G) homozygotes, and an odds ratio of 1.20 (CI: 1.07-1.42) for rs1219648(A;G) heterozygotes, compared with rs1219648(A;A) homozygotes.PMID 17529973 rs1219648 represents the SNP in the FGFR2 gene with the strongest association with breast cancer. However, nearby SNPs are almost as predictive. In particular, the following SNP alleles all have linkage values of 0.96 or greater with the rs1219648(G) allele in European populations: *rs2981579(A) *rs2420946(T) *rs11200014(A) An experimental rationale is presented indicating that this SNP is part of a haplotype that increases risk for ER+ breast cancer by increasing FGFR2 transcription. PMID 18285324 rs1219648 is not associated with endometriosis risk. rs1219648 may account for a substantial fraction of breast cancer in Arab (12%), Ashkenazi (15%), and Sephardi Jewish (22%) populations.

rs17817449 	T/G 	16 	53813367 	INTRONIC 	 	Within the FTO gene, many SNPs appear to be co-inherited. The SNP showing the strongest association with body weight (i.e. body mass index, BMI) is not rs17817449, although this SNP is one of co-inherited SNPs in the FTO gene region. For more information, refer to the FTO gene or the most studied of FTO SNPs, rs9930506. PMID 17658951 PMID 18316358 A study of 900+ Quebec individuals reported that rs17817449 was associated with BMI (p=0.0014), weight (p=0.0059) and waist circumference (p=0.0021) under an additive model, and in addition, influenced fasting insulin (p=0.011) and HOMA-IR (p=0.038). * Note: The three FTO SNPs, rs1421085, rs17817449, and rs9939609, are in strong linkage disequilibrium (pairwise r<sup>2</sup>>0.97), and there are two primary haplotypes, C-G-A (42.0 %) and T-T-T (55.5 %).

rs1800407 	C/T 	15 	28230318 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	 	rs1800407 is located in exon 13 of the OCA2 gene at amino acid position 419, and it is therefore also known as the R419Q variant. The (A) allele encodes the amino acid glutamine (instead of arginine), and it is associated with increased odds of having green/hazel eye color in some Caucasian populations. One copy of of rs1800407(A) is sufficient for this effect. PMID 12163334, PMID 15889046; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=203200&a=203200_AllelicVariant0012 OMIM 203200.0012 PMID 18093281 According to tree scanning analysis, the proportion of eye colour variation explained by this nucleotide position is merely 4%. Thus, additional variation present in the OCA2 gene and perhaps some other pigment related genes must be taken into account in order to explain the high phenotypic variation in iris colour. PMID 18252222 Among rs12913832(A;A) individuals, the penetrance for green/hazel eyes was 50%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, for rs1800407(A;A), (A;G), and (G;G) genotypes, respectively. R419Q is also a significant risk factor (odd ratio 1.27, p=0.0006) for cutaneous malignant melanoma.

rs1800588 	C/T 	15 	58723675 	INTRONIC 	HDL cholesterol 	rs1800588, also known as the -514C/T polymorphism of the LIPC gene, may influence the levels of the "good" cholestorols, the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterols.

rs1801133 	G/A 	1 	11856378 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Bone mass and geometry-Hip geometry, shaft section modulus, gender differentiated in males 	rs1801133 is a SNP that is relatively common and has been studied for (relatively) a long time. Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in the MTHFR gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in folate metabolism. Homozygous rs1801133(T;T) individuals have ~30% of the expected MTHFR enzyme activity, and rs1801133(C;T) heterozygotes have ~65% activity, compared to the most common genotype, rs1801133(C;C). This reduced activity (i.e. this SNP) has been linked at least once to each of the following disorders (though not necessarily reproducibly): *coronary artery disease *neural tube defects *migraine *thrombosis *preeclampsia *cleft lip/palate *autism *depression *schizophrenia *cancer, including **gastric cancer With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians.

rs1801133 	G/A 	1 	11856378 	DOWNSTREAM 	Bone mass and geometry-Hip geometry, shaft section modulus, gender differentiated in males 	rs1801133 is a SNP that is relatively common and has been studied for (relatively) a long time. Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in the MTHFR gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in folate metabolism. Homozygous rs1801133(T;T) individuals have ~30% of the expected MTHFR enzyme activity, and rs1801133(C;T) heterozygotes have ~65% activity, compared to the most common genotype, rs1801133(C;C). This reduced activity (i.e. this SNP) has been linked at least once to each of the following disorders (though not necessarily reproducibly): *coronary artery disease *neural tube defects *migraine *thrombosis *preeclampsia *cleft lip/palate *autism *depression *schizophrenia *cancer, including **gastric cancer With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk.

rs1801133 	G/A 	1 	11856378 	DOWNSTREAM 	Plasma homocysteine 	rs1801133 is a SNP that is relatively common and has been studied for (relatively) a long time. Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in the MTHFR gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in folate metabolism. Homozygous rs1801133(T;T) individuals have ~30% of the expected MTHFR enzyme activity, and rs1801133(C;T) heterozygotes have ~65% activity, compared to the most common genotype, rs1801133(C;C). This reduced activity (i.e. this SNP) has been linked at least once to each of the following disorders (though not necessarily reproducibly): *coronary artery disease *neural tube defects *migraine *thrombosis *preeclampsia *cleft lip/palate *autism *depression *schizophrenia *cancer, including **gastric cancer With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. PMID 18162478 A diplotype (according to the authors, but perhaps actually a genoset) of rs1801131 and rs1801133 has been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.PMID 18483342 '''Note:''' Another SNP in dbSNP, rs59514310, represents the same location as rs1801133.

rs2476601 	A/G 	1 	114377568 	DOWNSTREAM 	Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), gender differentiated in women 	This SNP, located in the PTPN22 gene and also known as R620W, or 1858C>T, may influence Rheumatoid Arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, including but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease and type-1 diabetes. The risk allele (in dbSNP orientation) is rs2476601(A). Note that rs6679667 and rs2476601 are reported to be perfectly correlated, so SNP determination of one predicts the other. PMID 17554300 In an expanded follow-up study of >6,000 controls and 6,000 patients, the heterozygote odds ratio for type-1 diabetes for this SNP was recalculated to be 1.98 (CI 1.82–2.15). PMID 17554260 rs2476601 was confirmed in another 2007 study to be a risk factor for RA PMID 17804836. *PMID 16490755 confirms the association of rs2476601 rheumatoid arthritis *PMID 15674368 two copies of the PTPN22 R620W allele more than doubles the risk for RF positive RA *PMID 15719322 see rs2476601(A;G) *PMID 15934099 *PMID 16052172 *PMID 16175503 *PMID 16185327 *PMID 16470599 rs2476601 shows a 0.75 (r squared) correlation with rs6679677, a SNP in the RSBN1 gene associated with rheumatoid arthritis. PMID 17554300 PMID 17133608 associations of rs2476601 in PTPN22 R620W single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with systemic sclerosis (SSc) or with anticentromere antibody (ACA)-positive or anti-topoisomerase I (anti-topo I) antibody-positive SSc, in a case-control study of US white, black, Hispanic, and Choctaw Indian individuals. PMID 17660222 studied ~300 UK patients with Behcet's disease and found that the R620W allele (i.e. rs2476601(A)) appeared to provide protection from Behcet's disease. The odds ratio for protection was calculated to be 2.4 (CI: 1.2 - 4.7). PMID 18200060 1858T allele had an allelic odds ratio (OR) of 2.16 for generalized vitiligo and a genotypic OR of 2.35 as C/T heterozygotes. Similarly, individuals carrying the PTPN22 1858T allele had an allelic OR of 2.05 for the expanded autoimmunity phenotype, and a genotypic OR of 2.19 for C/T heterozygotes. PMID 17934143 Confirms association of rs2476601 with type-1 diabetes in a Sardinian population of 490 sporadic patients (794 families).

PMID 16352685 In Asian (Japanese) populations, the presence of an rs3087243(G) allele represents a 1.3 fold increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease, and for those with autoimmune thyroid disease, a 1.5 fold increased risk of type-1 diabetes. However, in individuals without autoimmune thyroid disease, no association was seen between this SNP and type-1 diabetes. The authors speculate that earlier studies may have reported associations between this SNP and type-1 diabetes that were actually primarily based on the association with autoimmune thyroid disease. This same SNP, rs3087243, has also been implicated as a (minor) risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A study of 2,000+ European RA patients led to a calculated odds ratio of 1.13 (CI: 1.03 - 1.24) for the rs3087243(G) risk allele. PMID 16380915 In a study of 395 Spanish patients with lupus, rs3087243(G) allele carriers were calculated to have an odds ratio of 1.71 (CI: 1.18-2.49, p=0.003, p(corr) = 0.006).PMID 15248219 In a different study involving recipients of liver transplants, although also with Spanish patients, the rs3087243(G) allele was significantly associated with acute rejection (odds ratio 1.49, p(corr)=0.038). Patients who lacked this allele had the lowest risk of acute rejection development. Allograft survival data did not show statistical differences between genotypes.PMID 18047932 	CTLA4 	ENSG00000163599 	cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 	1493 	cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 	CELIAC DISEASE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO, 3; DIABETES MELLITUS, INSULIN-DEPENDENT, 12; GRAVES DISEASE; HASHIMOTO THYROIDITIS; HEPATITIS B VIRUS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO; CELIAC DISEASE; SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS; AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE 	Multiple Sclerosis | liver disease | lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis thyroid disease, autoimmune | diabetes, type 1 thyroid autoimmunity | dermatitis and eczema | hepatitis B, chronic | lymphoma | spondyloarthropathies | Graves disease | psoriasis | lupus erythematosus | rheumatoid arthritis | cholangitis, sclerosing | Lupus | diabetes, type 1 thyroid disease, autoimmune | indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase activity | IgE levels | Asthma. total IgE.

rs333 	GTCAGTATCAATTCTGGAAGAATTTCCAGACA/- 	3 	46414947 	UPSTREAM 	 	The chemokine receptor gene CCR5 plays an important role in many immune-related processes. rs333, the SNP designating the 'Delta 32' deletion of 32 nucleotides from within the gene, is perhaps the most famous allele of CCR5. Individuals carrying one copy of the Delta 32 SNP are somwhat resistant to infection by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and individuals with 2 copies (ie Delta 32 homozygotes; ~1% of Caucasians) are almost completely immune to infection by HIV. PMID 8898752 Is Delta 32 a SNP with an entirely positive/protective role? Probably not. In patients with abdominal aortic aneuryms (AAA's), the major risk is a sudden rupture - which is quite often fatal. Individuals with Delta 32 variants are more likely to have aneurysms than non-carriers, and among patients with aneurysms, Delta 32 carriers are more likely to rupture than to be caught in time to surgically repair.

rs4149056 	T/C 	12 	21331549 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	Serum bilirubin levels 	rs4149056 is a SNP in the SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes the 'organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1' (OATP1B1) protein. This protein, found primarily in the liver, regulates the uptake of numerous drugs and natural compounds. The rs4149056(C) allele gives rise to an amino acid change (from valine to alanine at residue 174) which has reduced uptake/transport activity. Therefore, drugs metabolized by OATP1B1 tend to build up to higher circulating concentrations than they would otherwise. Although there are also several other SNPs described from the SLCO1B1 gene, other than rs4149056, they don't (yet?) have obvious medical consequences PMID 16758257. The drugs known (or in some cases, thought) to be transported less well by the variant OATP1B1 protein encoded by the rs4149056(C) allele include: *Several cholesterol lowering statins, generally leading to reduced inhibitory effects on liver cholesterol synthesis and possibly worse side effects, by such drugs as: **pravastatin **rosuvastatin **pitavastatin *fexofenadine *repaglinide *methotrexate *the SN-38 active metabolite of irinotecan *rifampicin *caspofungin *lopinavir http://spittoon.23andme.com/2008/07/24/snpwatch-gene-variant-may-increase-risk-for-rare-side-effect-of-cholesterol-lowering-drugs/ spittoon discussion of this snp http://thegenesherpa.blogspot.com/2008/08/muscle-pain-from-statins-time-for.html The Gene Sherpa points out a 16x odds ratio for myopathy when taking statins and suggests fenofibrates might be a good alterative.

rs429358 	T/C 	19 	45411941 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	 	This SNP, located in the fourth exon of the ApoE gene, affects the amino acid at position 130 of the resulting protein. The more common rs429358 allele is (T); if the allele is (C) and the same chromosome also harbors the rs7412(C) allele, this allele is known as an ApoE4 allele. The risk for both early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease is increased for ApoE4 allele carriers, and it appears to be relatively dose-dependent. Therefore, the highest risk genotype is rs429358(C;C). Many studies have estimated the level of risk, and it varies depending on age, sex, ethnicity, and other factors. One meta-analysis estimated the odds ratios for homozygous rs429358(C;C) individuals compared to the more common ApoE3/ApoE3 homozygotes to be 12x for late-onset Alzheimer's and 61x for early-onset disease. PMID 10325447 Note: Although ApoE status is technically defined by these two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412, a SNP in the adjacent ApoC1 gene, rs4420638, is co-inherited with ApoE and thus predictive of it.

rs4420638 	A/G 	19 	45422946 	DOWNSTREAM 	Quantitative traits 	PMID 17192785 The researchers found that on testing DNA samples from 1,086 well-characterized Alzheimer's disease cases, a single SNP (rs4420638) lying 14 kb distal to the ApoE locus has a powerful association with late-onset AD (corrected p value was 5.3 x 10 e-34). One form of this SNP is very commonly inherited together with the APOE variant ApoE4 and thus predicts its presence. rs4420638(G;G) individuals have a 25-fold increased risk for developing the disease compared to ApoE3/ApoE3 carriers, whereas rs4420638(A;G) individuals have a ~3-fold increased risk. http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1567 AlzForum.org 2-3% of Caucasians are rs4420638(G;G), and perhaps 25%-30% are rs4420638(A;G). ApoE4 status is notable as being the variation that User:Watson|James Watson requested not to learn when having his genome sequenced. Note: the :Category:On_chip_Affy500k|Affymetrix 500K chip is said to poorly tag (ie assay) this particular SNP.

rs4779584 	T/C 	15 	32994756 	 	Colorectal cancer 	A study of 7000+ UK patients with colorectal cancer identified two SNPs that increase disease risk, one of which is rs4779584. Inheriting the rs4779584(T) risk allele is estimated to increase overall risk odds by 1.26x (CI: 1.19-1.34, p=4x10e-14). When analyzing data between genotypes, the odds ratios reported for heterozygotes was 1.23x (CI:1.13-1.33), and for rs4779584(T;T) homozygotes, 1.70 (CI: 1.41-2.04).PMID 18084292 Inheriting the risk variant at both SNP loci (i.e. rs4779584 and rs6983267) is estimated to increase the overall risk of developing colorectal cancer about 3 fold. The authors of this study are quoted as saying that "the lifetime risk of bowel cancer is about 5% in the UK so it's going up to 7% or so if you've got both bad copies of a variant." http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ng.2007.41.html nature

rs4880 	A/G 	6 	160113872 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	 	The rs4880(T) allele, part of the codon for amino acid valine at codon 16 of the antioxidant protein from the mitochrondrial superoxide dismutase 2 SOD2 gene, is the most common in most populations studied. The rs4880(C) allele gives rise to an alanine at this position. There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity PMID 15864132, and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals PMID 16538174. Regardless of how this resolves, several phenotypic associations have been reported for this SNP, including: * A 10 fold higher risk for heart disease in hereditary hemochromatosis patients with rs4880(T;T) genotypes compared to similar patients with rs4880(C;T) or rs4880(C;C) genotypes. PMID 15591282 * An increased risk of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) was found in individuals with rs4880(C;C) (OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 1.55-6.05) genotypes.

PMID 17290392 * Among prostate cancer patients with a rs4880(T;T) genotype (but not the (C;C) genotype, higher iron intake level was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in risk for aggressive forms of the cancer (OR=2.3, CI: 1.0-4.9).PMID 18296681 * rs4880(C;T) prostate cancer patients being treated by radiation therapy are more likely (8% compared to 0%, p=0.02) to exhibit a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding after irradiation than (C;C) or (T;T) patients, based on a study of 135 patients.

Another study also reports an association between rs599839(A) and higher LDL levels, in over 4,000 Caucasian Europeans. In one study, the (A) allele is associated with a 6% increase in nonfasting serum LDL, and in another, with a 25% increase in fasting serum LDL.PMID 18179892 rs646776 is a surrogate for rs599839, with linkage r<sup>2</sup>=0.88.

rs867186 	A/G 	20 	33764554 	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING 	 	rs867186 is a SNP that can indicate haplotype H3 of the EPCR gene. The protein product of the EPCR gene activates a part of the anticoagulation pathway. While the rs867186(A) allele could indicate haplotypes H1, H2 or H4, the rs867186(G) allele distinctly tags (identifies) the H3 haplotype.PMID 17849044 While most groups studying EPCR H3 agree that it leads to increased soluble EPCR, and thus should theoretically lead to reduced risk for venous thromboembolism, different groups come to different conclusions about the effect in the populations each studies. Two find no association PMID 15304035, PMID 15116250 while one finds that the H3 haplotype (and thus rs867186(G)) actually increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), with an odds ratio of 1.80, p=0.004.PMID 14576048 	PROCR 	ENSG00000101000 	protein C receptor, endothelial (EPCR) 	10544 	protein C receptor, endothelial (EPCR) 	 	protein C | sepsis | atherosclerosis, coronary | thrombophilia, venous | pregnancy loss, recurrent | thrombosis | myocardial infarct | cerebrovascular disease, ischemic | thrombosis, deep vein | thromboembolism, venous | thrombosis, venous | fetal loss, late | stroke 	INFECTION | HEMATOLOGICAL | REPRODUCTION | CARDIOVASCULAR 	Pulmonary Embolism | Genetic Predisposition to Disease | Thrombophlebitis | Venous Thrombosis | Coronary Disease | Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 | Myocardial Infarction | Thrombosis | Thromboembolism | Brain Ischemia | Cerebrovascular Disorders | Coronary Stenosis | Fetal Death | Cerebrovascular Accident | Thrombophilia | Retinal Vein Occlusion | Intracranial Thrombosis | Abortion, Habitual | Sepsis
